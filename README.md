# S.R.E. - Semantic Reality Engine

![S.R.E. Dashboard](public/screenshots/app-demo.webp)

> **"Reality is just a semantic vector waiting to be parsed."**

The **Semantic Reality Engine (S.R.E.)** is a high-fidelity frontend simulation of a domain-critical intelligence system, showcasing advanced React.js architecture. It combines a sleek Glassmorphism UI design with interactive simulations of complex, voice-activated compliance logic. The engine is designed to demonstrate how raw, natural language input can be instantly processed into structured, rule-compliant system data. A key example of this capability is the simulation of receiving unstructured voice commands in Hindi and converting them into verified, compliant English text outputs. Ultimately, S.R.E. serves as a futuristic concept prototype for bridging human interaction with complex backend intelligence.
